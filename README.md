# Web-Based Trivia Game

## Instructions
- Review the course expectations.

## Objectives
Students will complete weekly projects following the assignment instructions, then upload the project files to their GitHub repo using the VS Code software. This process is used throughout the program to support students in site testing by enabling them to post their assignments online and see them as the world would see them through a browser. This is a crucial objective that must be mastered for students to succeed.
