            <h2> Passion for Web Development </h2>
            <p> My name is <strong id="firstname">Plamedie</strong>, and I am passionate about web development.
                Currently, I'm in my second year of college, pursuing a degree in web development. I love working with
                both front-end and back-end technologies, but I have a special interest in HTML and would love to learn
                more about Javascript. I enjoy solving problems creatively and building projects that engage users.</p>

            <h2> My Journey as an International Student </h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC), and my journey as an international
                student has been both challenging and rewarding. Moving abroad for my education has pushed me out of my
                comfort zone, teaching me resilience and adaptability. Adjusting to a new environment while keeping up
                with academic demands hasn’t always been easy, but I embrace every opportunity to grow. My background
                has shaped my perspective and given me the determination to work hard and succeed in my chosen field.

            <h2> The Importance of Family </h2>
            <p>
                Family is one of the most important aspects of my life. No matter where I am, I always make an effort to
                stay connected with my loved ones. Being far from home has made me appreciate even more the bonds that
                hold us together. I value deep, meaningful relationships, and I try to bring warmth and sincerity into
                my friendships and collaborations. Having a strong support system gives me motivation and keeps me
                grounded.

            <h2> Cooking: A Creative and Cultural Connection </h2>
            <p>
                Another thing I love is cooking. It’s not just a way to eat—it’s an experience. I enjoy trying out new
                recipes and preparing traditional Congolese dishes even though I not an expert, which remind me of home.
                Cooking allows me to express my creativity and relax after a long day. I also love sharing food with
                others because, for me, meals are a way to bring people together and create lasting memories.
                Here are some recipes that I love cooking:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>pankakes.</em></li>
                <li><em>roast chicken leg with baked potatoes.</em> </li>
                <li><em>lasagna.</em></li>
            </ul>

            <h2> A Love for Travel and Exploration </h2>
            <p>
                I also have a passion for travel. Exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and trying new
                foods excite me. Traveling gives me the chance to see the world from new perspectives and step outside
                my routine. Whether it’s a short trip or a big adventure, I always embrace the opportunity to learn and
                grow from the experience.

            <h2> Looking Ahead: Growth and Future Aspirations </h2>
            <p>
                As I continue my journey in web development and beyond, I am always looking for ways to improve and
                challenge myself. Whether I’m coding, cooking, or planning my next trip, I put my heart into what I do.
                My combination of technical skills, cultural appreciation, and strong personal values shapes who I am,
                and I look forward to seeing where my journey takes me next.
