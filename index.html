            <h2> Passion for Web Development </h2>
            <p> My name is <strong>Plamedie</strong>, and I am passionate about web development. Currently, I'm in my second year of college, pursuing a degree in web development. I love working with both front-end and back-end technologies, but I have a special interest in JavaScript. One of my favorite projects is a web-based trivia game that I've been working on, where I get to manipulate the DOM, track user progress, and create an interactive experience. I enjoy solving problems creatively and building projects that engage users.</p>

            <h2> My Journey as an International Student </h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC), and my journey as an international student has been both challenging and rewarding. Moving abroad for my education has pushed me out of my comfort zone, teaching me resilience and adaptability. Adjusting to a new environment while keeping up with academic demands hasn’t always been easy, but I embrace every opportunity to grow. My background has shaped my perspective and given me the determination to work hard and succeed in my chosen field.

            <h2> The Importance of Family </h2>
            <p>
                Family is one of the most important aspects of my life. No matter where I am, I always make an effort to stay connected with my loved ones. Being far from home has made me appreciate even more the bonds that hold us together. I value deep, meaningful relationships, and I try to bring warmth and sincerity into my friendships and collaborations. Having a strong support system gives me motivation and keeps me grounded.

            <h2> Cooking: A Creative and Cultural Connection </h2>
            <p>
                Another thing I love is cooking. It’s not just a way to eat—it’s an experience. I enjoy trying out new recipes and preparing traditional Congolese dishes even though I not an expert, which remind me of home. Cooking allows me to express my creativity and relax after a long day. I also love sharing food with others because, for me, meals are a way to bring people together and create lasting memories.
                Here are some recipes that I love cooking:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>pankakes.</em></li>
                <li><em>roast chicken leg with baked potatoes.</em> </li>
                <li><em>lasagna.</em></li>
            </ul>

                I also have a passion for travel. Exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and trying new foods excite me. Traveling gives me the chance to see the world from new perspectives and step outside my routine. Whether it’s a short trip or a big adventure, I always embrace the opportunity to learn and grow from the experience.
